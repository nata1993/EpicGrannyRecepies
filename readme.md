# Epic Granny Recepies! :P

I know I know... Lame name for the app... But think about your granny. She is/was epic, right?! :P

Now... This app is about single Granny in this world who has made so many tasty meals over her life.
The cooking is 100% home made, not processed industrially or anything. Well except maybe canned corn etc.
In modern times where food is heavily processed and information is the easiest to share with everyone
and also preserve the past for later use or for reminiscence, Granny recepies come real handy in cooking
proper meals that are tasty and will make you full for long time of the day. Beware though, some meals
are very heavy on calories despite being just normal everyday food. For an instance, the borsch soup.
The soup is everyday food but if you make it like the spoon will be standing in your plate vertically,
well then you will have great experience of being full for the better part of next six hours!

All in all, this project is basically in a way a preservation of information about home cooked meal
recepies. Work is still in progress and new recepies constantly being added over time.

If you want to have some recepie added from not this Epic Granny I have, then unfortunately you are
looking at the wrong project. Any other modification or improvement to the app is welcome and
appreciated, but recepies will not be added from third party people.
Existing recepies will also not be modified to be exactly step by step with all the ingredients and
their amount needed. Experimentation is the key, just like Granny would like you to learn.
